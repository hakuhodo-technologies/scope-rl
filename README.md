## Overview

*SCOPE-RL* is an open-source Python Software for implementing the end-to-end procedure regarding **offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL)**, from data collection to offline policy learning, off-policy performance evaluation, and policy selection. Our software includes a series of modules to implement synthetic dataset generation, dataset preprocessing, estimators for Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE), and Off-Policy Selection (OPS) methods.

This software is also compatible with [d3rlpy](https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy), which implements a range of online and offline RL methods. SCOPE-RL enables an easy, transparent, and reliable experiment in offline RL research on any environment with [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) and [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)-like interface. It also facilitates the implementation of offline RL in practice on a variety of customized datasets and real-world datasets.

In particular, SCOPE-RL enables and facilitates evaluation and algorithm comparison related to the following research topics:

- **Offline Reinforcement Learning**: Offline RL aims at learning a new policy from only offline logged data collected by a behavior policy. SCOPE-RL enables flexible experiments using customized datasets collected by various behavior policies and environments.

- **Off-Policy Evaluation**: OPE aims at evaluating the performance of a counterfactual policy using only offline logged data. SCOPE-RL supports many OPE estimators and streamlines the experimental procedure to evaluate and compare OPE estimators. Moreover, we also implement advanced OPE methods, such as estimators based on state-action density estimation and cumulative distribution estimation.

- **Off-Policy Selection**: OPS aims at identifying the best-performing policy from a pool of several candidate policies using offline logged data. SCOPE-RL supports some basic OPS methods and provides several metrics to evaluate the OPS accuracy.

This software is inspired by [Open Bandit Pipeline](https://github.com/st-tech/zr-obp), which is a library for OPE in contextual bandits. However, SCOPE-RL also implements a set of OPE estimators and tools to facilitate experiments about OPE for the contextual bandit setup by itself as well as those for RL.

### Implementations

*SCOPE-RL* mainly consists of the following three modules.
- [**dataset module**](./_gym/dataset): This module provides tools to generate synthetic data from any environment on top of [OpenAI Gym](http://gym.openai.com/) and [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)-like interface. It also provides tools to pre-process the logged data.
- [**policy module**](./_gym/policy): This module provides a wrapper class for [d3rlpy](https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy) to enable flexible data collection.
- [**ope module**](./_gym/ope): This module provides a generic abstract class to implement OPE estimators. It also provides some tools useful for performing OPS.

Note that in addition to the above OPE and OPS methods, researchers can easily implement and compare their own estimators through a generic abstract class implemented in SCOPE-RL. Moreover, practitioners can apply the above methods to their real-world data to evaluate and choose counterfactual policies for their own practical situations.

To provide an example of performing a customized experiment imitating a practical setup, we also provide [RTBGym](./rtbgym) and [RecGym](./recgym), RL environments for Real-Time Bidding (RTB) and Recommender Systems.

## Installation

You can install SCOPE-RL using Python's package manager `pip`.
```
pip install scope-rl
```

You can also install SCOPE-RL from the source.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hakuhodo-technologies/scope-rl
cd scope-rl
python setup.py install
```

SCOPE-RL supports Python 3.9 or newer. See [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for other requirements. Please also refer to issue [#17](https://github.com/hakuhodo-technologies/scope-rl/issues/17) when you encounter some dependency conflicts.

## Usage

Here, we provide an example workflow to perform offline RL, OPE, and OPS using SCOPE-RL on [RTBGym](./rtbgym).

### Synthetic Dataset Generation and Data Preprocessing

Let's start by generating some synthetic logged data useful for performing offline RL.

```Python
# implement a data collection procedure on the RTBGym environment

# import SCOPE-RL modules
from scope_rl.dataset import SyntheticDataset
from scope_rl.policy import EpsilonGreedyHead
# import d3rlpy algorithms
from d3rlpy.algos import DoubleDQNConfig
from d3rlpy.dataset import create_fifo_replay_buffer
from d3rlpy.algos import ConstantEpsilonGreedy
# import rtbgym and gym
import rtbgym
import gym
import torch
# random state
random_state = 12345
device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

# (0) Setup environment
env = gym.make("RTBEnv-discrete-v0")

# (1) Learn a baseline policy in an online environment (using d3rlpy)
# initialize the algorithm
ddqn = DoubleDQNConfig().create(device=device)
# train an online policy
# this takes about 5min to compute
ddqn.fit_online(
    env,
    buffer=create_fifo_replay_buffer(limit=10000, env=env),
    explorer=ConstantEpsilonGreedy(epsilon=0.3),
    n_steps=100000,
    n_steps_per_epoch=1000,
    update_start_step=1000,
)

# (2) Generate a logged dataset
# convert the ddqn policy into a stochastic behavior policy
behavior_policy = EpsilonGreedyHead(
    ddqn,
    n_actions=env.action_space.n,
    epsilon=0.3,
    name="ddqn_epsilon_0.3",
    random_state=random_state,
)
# initialize the dataset class
dataset = SyntheticDataset(
    env=env,
    max_episode_steps=env.step_per_episode,
)
# the behavior policy collects some logged data
train_logged_dataset = dataset.obtain_episodes(
  behavior_policies=behavior_policy,
  n_trajectories=10000,
  random_state=random_state,
)
test_logged_dataset = dataset.obtain_episodes(
  behavior_policies=behavior_policy,
  n_trajectories=10000,
  random_state=random_state + 1,
)
```

### Offline Reinforcement Learning
We are now ready to learn a new policy (evaluation policy) from the logged data using [d3rlpy](https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy).

```Python
# implement an offline RL procedure using SCOPE-RL and d3rlpy

# import d3rlpy algorithms
from d3rlpy.dataset import MDPDataset
from d3rlpy.algos import DiscreteCQLConfig

# (3) Learning a new policy from offline logged data (using d3rlpy)
# convert the logged dataset into d3rlpy's dataset format
offlinerl_dataset = MDPDataset(
    observations=train_logged_dataset["state"],
    actions=train_logged_dataset["action"],
    rewards=train_logged_dataset["reward"],
    terminals=train_logged_dataset["done"],
)
# initialize the algorithm
cql = DiscreteCQLConfig().create(device=device)
# train an offline policy
cql.fit(
    offlinerl_dataset,
    n_steps=10000,
)
```

### Basic Off-Policy Evaluation

Then, we evaluate the performance of several evaluation policies (ddqn, cql, and random) using offline logged data collected by the behavior policy. Specifically, we compare the estimation results of various OPE estimators, including Direct Method (DM), Trajectory-wise Importance Sampling (TIS), Per-Decision Importance Sampling (PDIS), and Doubly Robust (DR) below.

```Python
# implement a basic OPE procedure using SCOPE-RL

# import SCOPE-RL modules
from scope_rl.ope import CreateOPEInput
from scope_rl.ope import OffPolicyEvaluation as OPE
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import DirectMethod as DM
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import TrajectoryWiseImportanceSampling as TIS
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import PerDecisionImportanceSampling as PDIS
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import DoublyRobust as DR

# (4) Evaluate the learned policy in an offline manner
# we compare ddqn, cql, and random policy
cql_ = EpsilonGreedyHead(
    base_policy=cql,
    n_actions=env.action_space.n,
    name="cql",
    epsilon=0.0,
    random_state=random_state,
)
ddqn_ = EpsilonGreedyHead(
    base_policy=ddqn,
    n_actions=env.action_space.n,
    name="ddqn",
    epsilon=0.0,
    random_state=random_state,
)
random_ = EpsilonGreedyHead(
    base_policy=ddqn,
    n_actions=env.action_space.n,
    name="random",
    epsilon=1.0,
    random_state=random_state,
)
evaluation_policies = [cql_, ddqn_, random_]
# create input for the OPE class
prep = CreateOPEInput(
    env=env,
)
input_dict = prep.obtain_whole_inputs(
    logged_dataset=test_logged_dataset,
    evaluation_policies=evaluation_policies,
    require_value_prediction=True,
    n_trajectories_on_policy_evaluation=100,
    random_state=random_state,
)
# initialize the OPE class
ope = OPE(
    logged_dataset=test_logged_dataset,
    ope_estimators=[DM(), TIS(), PDIS(), DR()],
)
# perform OPE and visualize the result
ope.visualize_off_policy_estimates(
    input_dict,
    random_state=random_state,
    sharey=True,
)
```

More formal example implementations with RTBGym are available at [./examples/quickstart/rtb/](./examples/quickstart/rtb). Those with RecGym are also available at [./examples/quickstart/rec/](./examples/quickstart/rec).

### Advanced Off-Policy Evaluation

We can also estimate various statics of the evaluation policy, beyond just its expected performance, including variance and conditional value at risk (CVaR) via estimating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the reward under the evaluation policy.

```Python
# implement a cumulative distribution estimation procedure using SCOPE-RL

# import SCOPE-RL modules
from scope_rl.ope import CumulativeDistributionOPE
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import CumulativeDistributionDM as CD_DM
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import CumulativeDistributionTIS as CD_IS
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import CumulativeDistributionTDR as CD_DR
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import CumulativeDistributionSNTIS as CD_SNIS
from scope_rl.ope.discrete import CumulativeDistributionSNTDR as CD_SNDR

# (4) Evaluate the cumulative distribution function of the reward under the evaluation policy (in an offline manner)
# we compare ddqn, cql, and random policy defined from the previous section (i.e., (3) of basic OPE procedure)
# initialize the OPE class
cd_ope = CumulativeDistributionOPE(
    logged_dataset=test_logged_dataset,
    ope_estimators=[
      CD_DM(estimator_name="cd_dm"),
      CD_IS(estimator_name="cd_is"),
      CD_DR(estimator_name="cd_dr"),
      CD_SNIS(estimator_name="cd_snis"),
      CD_SNDR(estimator_name="cd_sndr"),
    ],
)
# estimate the variance
variance_dict = cd_ope.estimate_variance(input_dict)
# estimate the CVaR
cvar_dict = cd_ope.estimate_conditional_value_at_risk(input_dict, alphas=0.3)
# estimate and visualize the cumulative distribution function of the policy performance
cd_ope.visualize_cumulative_distribution_function(input_dict, n_cols=4)
```

### Off-Policy Selection and Evaluation of OPE/OPS

We can also select the best-performing policy among a set of candidate policies based on the OPE results using the OPS class. It is also possible to evaluate the reliability of OPE/OPS using various metrics such as mean squared error, rank correlation, regret, and type I and type II error rates.

```Python
# perform off-policy selection based on the OPE results

# import SCOPE-RL modules
from scope_rl.ope import OffPolicySelection

# (5) Conduct Off-Policy Selection
# Initialize the OPS class
ops = OffPolicySelection(
    ope=ope,
    cumulative_distribution_ope=cd_ope,
)
# rank the candidate policies by their policy value estimated by (basic) OPE
ranking_dict = ops.select_by_policy_value(input_dict)
# rank the candidate policies by their policy value estimated by cumulative distribution OPE
ranking_dict_ = ops.select_by_policy_value_via_cumulative_distribution_ope(input_dict)
# visualize the top k deployment result
ops.visualize_topk_policy_value_selected_by_standard_ope(
    input_dict=input_dict,
    compared_estimators=["dm", "tis", "pdis", "dr"],
    relative_safety_criteria=1.0,
)
```

ranking_df, metric_df = ops.select_by_lower_quartile(
    input_dict,
    alpha=0.3,
    return_metrics=True,
    return_by_dataframe=True,
)
# visualize the OPS results with the ground-truth metrics
