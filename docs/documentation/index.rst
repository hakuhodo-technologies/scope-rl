Overview
~~~~~~~~~~
*SCOPE-RL* is an open-source Python library designed for both Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Off-Policy Evaluation and Selection (OPE/OPS). This library is intended to streamline offline RL research by providing an easy, flexible, and reliable platform for conducting experiments. It also offers straightforward implementations for practitioners. SCOPE-RL incorporates a series of modules that allow for synthetic dataset generation, dataset preprocessing, and the conducting and evaluation of OPE/OPS.

SCOPE-RL can be used in any RL environment that has an interface similar to `OpenAI Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_ or `Gymnasium <https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium>`_-like interface.
The library is also compatible with `d3rlpy <https://github.com/takuseno/d3rlpy>`_ which implements both online and offline RL methods.

Our software facilitates implementation, evaluation and algorithm comparison related to the following research topics:

* **Offline Reinforcement Learning**:
   Offline RL aims to train a new policy from only offline logged data collected by a behavior policy. SCOPE-RL enables a flexible experiment using customized datasets on diverse environments collected by various behavior policies.

* **Off-Policy Evaluation**:
   OPE aims to evaluate the performance of a counterfactual policy using only offline logged data. SCOPE-RL supports implementations of a range of OPE estimators and streamlines the experimental procedure to evaluate the accuracy of OPE estimators.

* **Off-Policy Selection**:
   OPS aims to select the top-:math:`k` policies from several candidate policies using only offline logged data. Typically, the final production policy is chosen based on the online A/B tests of the top-:math:`k` policies selected by OPS.
   SCOPE-RL supports implementations of a range of OPS methods and provides some metrics to evaluate the OPS result.

.. note::

   This documentation aims to provide a gentle introduction to offline RL and OPE/OPS in the following steps.

   1. Explain the basic concepts in :doc:`Overview (online/offline RL) <online_offline_rl>` and :doc:`Overview (OPE/OPS) <ope_ops>`.
   2. Provide various examples of conducting offline RL and OPE/OPS in practical problem settings in :doc:`Quickstart <quickstart>` and :doc:`Example Codes <examples/index>`.
   3. Describe the algorithms and implementations in detail in :doc:`Supported Implementation <evaluation_implementation>` and :doc:`Package Reference <scope_rl_api>`.

    :text-align: center

    Cumulative Distribution Function Estimated by OPE Estimators

SCOPE-RL also provides cumulative distribution OPE estimators, which enables practitioners to evaluate various risk metrics (e.g., conditional value at risk) for safety assessment beyond the mere expectation of the trajectory-wise reward.
Meta class and generic abstract class are also available for cumulative distribution OPE.

^^^^^^
* Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
* Mean (i.e., policy value)
* Variance
* Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
* Interquartile Range

Off-Policy Selection Metrics
----------

    :text-align: center

    Comparison of the Top-k Statistics of 10% Lower Quartile of Policy Value

Finally, SCOPE-RL also standardizes the evaluation protocol of OPE in two axes, firstly by measuring the accuracy of OPE over the whole candidate policies, and secondly by evaluating the gains and costs in top-k deployment (e.g., the best and worst performance in top-k deployment). The streamlined implementations and visualization of OPS class provide informative insights on offline RL and OPE performance.

OPE metrics
^^^^^^
* Mean Squared Error :cite:`paine2020hyperparameter, voloshin2021empirical, fu2021benchmarks`
* Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient :cite:`paine2020hyperparameter, fu2021benchmarks`
* Regret :cite:`paine2020hyperparameter, fu2021benchmarks`
* Type I and Type II Error Rates

OPS metrics (performance of top :math:`k` deployment policies)
^^^^^^
* {Best/Worst/Mean/Std} of {policy value/conditional value at risk/lower quartile}
* Safety violation rate
* Sharpe ratio (our proposal)

    Among the top-:math:`k` risk-return tradeoff metrics, **SharpeRatio** is the main proposal of our research paper 
    **"Towards Assessing and Benchmarking Risk-Return Tradeoff of Off-Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement Learning."** 
    We describe the motivation and contributions of the SharpeRatio metric in :doc:`sharpe_ratio`.
